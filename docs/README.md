## 🌟 Overview

The Server Access Dashboard (S-A-D) is a full-stack web application designed to process and display the often-cluttered access logs from Nginx Proxy Manager in a user-friendly interface. It collects log entries, enriches them with geo-information, and provides interactive filtering and sorting capabilities for easy analysis of server traffic.

## ✨ Features

- **Automated Log Collection:** Periodically processes `.log` and rotated `.gz` files from Nginx Proxy Manager.
- **GeoIP Enrichment:** Determines the country of origin for each IP address and displays the corresponding flag.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** A paginated and sortable table view of all access logs.
- **Powerful Filtering:** Filter logs by IP address, country, domain, or HTTP status code.
- **Visual Summary:** A summary view shows the top-accessing countries at a glance.
- **User Authentication:** A login page protects the dashboard. Passwords are hashed with bcrypt, and sessions use short-lived JWT access tokens with automatic refresh.
- **Modern Frontend:** A responsive single-page application built with Vue.js and styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **Robust Backend:** A high-performance API powered by FastAPI and SQLAlchemy.
- **Simple Deployment:** Fully containerized and configured with a `docker-compose` file for a quick start.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the dashboard running on your server.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose must be installed on your system.
- You need the path to the `logs` directory of your Nginx Proxy Manager instance.

### Installation

1.  **Copy the `docker-compose-sad.yml` file:**
    Or create a file named `docker-compose.yml` and paste the following content into it:

    ```yaml
    services:
      sad-backend:
        image: ghcr.io/flitschi7/server-access-dashboard/sad-backend:latest
        container_name: sad-backend
        restart: unless-stopped
        volumes:
          - /FOLDER_TO_NGINXPROXYMANAGER/nginxproxymanager/data/logs:/nginx_logs:ro
          - /APP_FOLDER:/app/database
        ports:
          - 8000:8000
        environment:
          - DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////app/database/logs.db
          - LOG_DIRECTORY=/nginx_logs
          - ADMIN_USERNAME=${ADMIN_USERNAME:-admin}
          - ADMIN_PASSWORD=${ADMIN_PASSWORD:?set a strong admin password}
          - JWT_SECRET=${JWT_SECRET:?set a long random secret}
          - GEOIP_DATABASE_PATH=/app/database/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb
          - MAXMIND_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_MAXMIND_LICENSE_KEY
          - LOG_COLLECTION_INTERVAL_MINUTES=${LOG_COLLECTION_INTERVAL_MINUTES:-90} # Default to 90 minutes

      sad-frontend:
        image: ghcr.io/flitschi7/server-access-dashboard/sad-frontend:latest
        container_name: sad-frontend
        restart: unless-stopped
        ports:
          - 5577:80
        environment:
          - API_URL=YOUR_API_URL
        depends_on:
          - sad-backend
    ```

2.  **Configuration**

    Before starting the containers, you need to configure the environment variables in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

    - **`ADMIN_USERNAME`**: (Optional) The username for the dashboard login. Defaults to `admin`.
    - **`ADMIN_PASSWORD`**: (**Mandatory**) The password for the dashboard login. Set this to a strong, random string. The container will fail to start if this is not set.
    - **`JWT_SECRET`**: (**Mandatory**) A long, random string used to sign authentication tokens. Generate one with `openssl rand -hex 32`. The container will fail to start if this is not set.
    - **`ADMIN_PASSWORD`**: (**Mandatory**) The password for the dashboard admin user. Bcrypt-hashed at startup and stored in the database; it is never stored in plaintext. The container will fail to start if this is not set.
    - **`CORS_ORIGINS`**: (**Recommended**) A comma-separated list of frontend origins allowed to call the backend API, e.g. `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:5577`. Defaults to `http://localhost:5577`. Since authentication uses a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header (not cookies), cross-origin credential access is not permitted by default.
    - **`API_URL`**: In the `sad-frontend` service, set this to the external URL of your backend, e.g., `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8000`.
    - **`MAXMIND_LICENSE_KEY`**: This is a **mandatory** free license key from MaxMind, which is required to download the GeoIP database for country lookups.

    **How to get your MaxMind License Key:**

    1.  Sign up for a free GeoLite2 account on the [MaxMind website](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup).
    2.  After signing up and logging in, navigate to "Manage License Keys" in the left-hand menu.
    3.  Click "Generate new license key" and give it a descriptive name (e.g., "sad-dashboard").
    4.  Copy the generated key and paste it as the value for `MAXMIND_LICENSE_KEY` in your `docker-compose.yml`.

3.  **Start the application:**
    Run the following command in the same directory where you saved your `docker-compose.yml` file:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4.  **Access the Dashboard:**
    The application is now accessible at `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:5577`. You will be redirected to a login page. Enter the `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` credentials you configured above. After the first start, it may take a few minutes for the initial log entries to be processed and become visible.

    Authentication uses signed JWT tokens. Your session persists across page reloads via browser storage, and access tokens are automatically refreshed when they expire. Click the "Logout" button in the dashboard header to sign out.
